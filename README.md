Faces.ipynb contains a function draw_faces which constructs an initial face from a photo and then constructs faces from it. Before using of this function make sure your dataset satisfies the following conditions:
1) There are maximum 18 fearures.
2) There is a column called "label" to subscipt faces.
4) Values in a dataset are in range 0.35 and 1 for face traits not to be very tiny (apply MinMax scaler)
Out[uts will be in separate files whose name start with "faces_output_column_"
Besides, in the same file there is an example of Chernoff faces impemented to PCA scatter plot applied to Fisher's iris data set
