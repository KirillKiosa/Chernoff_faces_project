Faces.ipynb contains a function draw_faces which constructs an initial face from a photo and then constructs faces from it
NOTE:
1) Each dataset can contain up to 18 features.
2) To make labels under each output, create a column called "label".
3) Output will be depicted in separate files whose name start with "faces_output_column_"
4) It's important to apply MinMax scaler in range 0.35 and 1 for face traits not to be very tiny
Besides, in the same file there is an example of Chernoff faces impemented to PCA scatter plot applied to Fisher's iris data set
